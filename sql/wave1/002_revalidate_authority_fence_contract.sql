-- Wave 1 IR-D-003 hardening for migration/replay safety.
--
-- 001 may be applied into an environment where the logical schema already exists.
-- This migration makes reuse fail closed: an existing authority_fences table must
-- satisfy the canonical identifier and positive-epoch contract before Wave 1 can
-- consider it eligible for authority use. Invalid historical rows make validation
-- fail; they are not normalized, deleted, or silently accepted here.
